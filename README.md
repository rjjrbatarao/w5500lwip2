w5500lwip
Compatible with Ethernet Wiznet 5500 ESP32 and ESP8266 Static or DHCP Modes available. It is a very raw script but it works, also the dns server.

What it needs to run:

Setup the wifi module "on" or at least "WiFi.mode(WIFI_OFF)" to bring up the lwip interface and the "WiFiClient"

Arduino's setup() example:

static ip: uint8_t mac_addr[6] = { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xFE, 0xE }; IPAddress ip(192, 168, 1, 50); IPAddress subnet(255, 255, 255, 0); IPAddress gateway(192, 168, 1, 1); IPAddress dns(192, 168, 1, 1);
Ethernet.begin(mac_addr,ip,subnet,gateway, dns);

dhcp ip: Ethernet.begin(mac_addr);

to use some client just use: WiFiClient wifiClient;
That's it!

!!! Note: the are a lot of work to do eg. handling link states, reconnections, transitions, Eth configuration things and so on... !!!
